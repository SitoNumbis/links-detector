## Problem

So you read a book or a magazine and see the link like `https://some-url.com/which/may/be/long?and_with_params=true`, but you can't click on it since it is printed. To visit this link you need to start typing it in the browser's address bar character by character, which may be pretty annoying and error prone.

## Solution

Links Detector tries to detect and recognize such links for you and makes it clickable using you smartphone camera. So in result you should do just one click on the link instead of typing the whole link manually character by character.

## Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è Currently the application is in _experimental_ _Alpha_ stage and has [many issues and limitations](https://github.com/trekhleb/links-detector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement). So don't raise your expectations bar to high until these issues are resolved ü§∑üèª‚Äç.

## Technologies

Links Detector is a _serverless_ frontend [React](https://create-react-app.dev/) application. It means that links detection happens right in your browser and not on the server.

Links Detector is [PWA (Progressive Web App)](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) friendly. It means that while you navigate through the app it will try to cache all resources to make consequent visits much faster and to save your network traffic. It also means that it is possible for the application to work offline once you visited all the pages you're interested in.

The detection and recognition part was made possible by using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js).
