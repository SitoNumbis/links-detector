## The Problem

So you read a book or a magazine and see the link, but you can't click on it since it is printed. If it would be a QR code you would just scan it using your smartphone camera, but what about the links like `https://some.url.com/which/may/be/long?and_with_params=true`? Normally you would start typing the link in the browser's address bar character by character, which may be pretty annoying and error prune.

## The Solution

Links Detector **tries** to detect and recognize such links for you and make it clickable using you smartphone camera. So in result you should do just one click instead of typing the whole link manually character by character.
